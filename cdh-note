Apache Hadoop stores and processes data in a distributed fashion. 
To achieve this goal, Hadoop implements a master and slave model. 
The namenode and jobtracker daemons are master daemons, whereas the datanode and tasktracker daemons are slave daemons.

Namenode   master
Secondary namenode   master
Jobtracker master
Datanode  slave
Tasktracker slave


client -> [jobTracker] -> [taskTracker]

The secondary namenode is a checkpoint service for the namenode daemon
that performs periodic merging of the edits log and the fsimage file.

the secondary namenode [namenode daemon] [edits] ->periodic merging<- [fsimage]


Checkpoint Size: If the edits logfile reaches this checkpoint size, 
the secondary namenode daemon will perform the checkpoint even if the check point period has not elapsed.

Note: after performing checkpoint, edits logfile size will become very small or 0.

RPC: remote Procedure Call , it is used to ask application to do something from remote pc via network.


Question? what is different for fsimage and eitds among namenode and the secondary namenode?
