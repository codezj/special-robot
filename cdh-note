Apache Hadoop stores and processes data in a distributed fashion. 
To achieve this goal, Hadoop implements a master and slave model. 
The namenode and jobtracker daemons are master daemons, whereas the datanode and tasktracker daemons are slave daemons.

Namenode   master
Secondary namenode   master
Jobtracker master
Datanode  slave
Tasktracker slave
